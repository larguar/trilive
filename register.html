<h1>The Resurgence of Cryptocurrency</h1>
<p class="lead text-center">Is Bitcoin back?  How does Facebook’s Libra fit in? What will regulations look like? Find out from cryptocurrency experts – live and online!</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Back in 2017 we started warning our readers that cryptocurrencies were in a massive bubble…</p>
<p>And we were right.</p>
<p>Bitcoin surged to $20,000 and the entire cryptocurrency market more than tripled in just 2 months!</p>
<p>And then, the bubble popped in early 2018.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Dash… they all came tumbling down with Bitcoin falling as low as $3,000.</p>
<p>But now… Bitcoin and the gang are back for round 2.</p>
<div class="full-img">
	<img src="https://csresearch.s3.amazonaws.com/TRI/2019/TRILive/OFChart.png" class="img-fluid">
</div>
<p>And NOW we’re paying attention. Because decades of research proves that once the initial shake-out happens, the second wave of an innovation like this is almost always longer and stronger.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve assembled <em>The Rich Investor </em>team and some special guests to deliver all the information you need <em>right now</em> to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>



<h2>Bitcoin or Bust?</h2>
<p>Whether you don’t know the difference between blockchain and bitcoin or you’ve got a crypto mining PC network in your garage…</p>
<p>There will be something for everyone.</p>
<p>We’ve recruited several in-demand crypto experts to join our very own team of investment experts…</p>
<p>People who have helped our readers manage the ups and downs of the markets and make a ton of money in the process.</p>
<p>Now that it’s clear the bubble has popped and the second wave has begun, it’s time to get serious.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not interested in buying cryptocurrencies yet, you’ll be interested to hear our guests talk about what’s coming next…</p>
<ul class="check">
	<li><strong>What industries are going to be impacted the most… some will rise and some will fall</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Which companies are making huge investments in blockchain (and whether it makes them good investments)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Why Bitcoin is NOT the one coin we’d recommend if you do want to get into cryptocurrencies</strong></li>
	<li><strong>How to protect your cryptocurrencies – remember, these don’t fall under FDIC rules in your bank account</strong></li>
	<li><strong>And much, much more</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s the best part… you can watch all the presentations from the comfort of your own home.</p>
